===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

# How to run the game.
To run the game, open up the html file in your browser.

## How to play the game.
To play the game, you move the character around on the canvas using the arrow keys.

## The goal of the game.
The goal of the game is simple, get the player to have a score of 1,000 points or more and reach the water to win. If the bugs run into you they take -20 off of your score and send you back to the starting point. the Gem will give you 50 each time you touch it and will spawn randomly across the canvas. Once you reach the goal your player score will reset back to 0.
